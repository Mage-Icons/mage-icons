Mage Icons is an open-source icon system designed with solely user interface and SAAS production in mind. The icons are constructed using a 24x24 pixel grid, ideal for smaller viewing experiences. All the icons are free for personal and commercial use. Mage Icons is a project under development and we are working on bringing you a library flexible for all development and design environments. Thank you for your support, we hope to bring many more beautiful icons to your design.

## Usage  
  
Mage Icons is designed with ease of use in mind. Our primary goal was to make searching icons easier using tags. Each icon has multiple tags attached to it. The same "Hamburger menu" icon can be searched by typing "Three Lines", "Menu", "Dash", etc.  
  
Then designers can simply click the copy button and then press `âŒ˜+V` or `Ctrl+V` to paste the vector graphic into your Figma file directly.
  
## Product Roadmap
  
- Mage Icons is still in its beta version. Our first priority is to improve the consistency and quality of our icons for all designs before we release version 1. We're actively taking feedback from designers and our community.
- We are working on adding many more icons to the library so that MageIcons can be your go-to library for all projects.  
- Development environment support for all the major tech stacks will be rolled out in future updates.
