## Usage  
  
Mage Icons is designed with ease of use in mind. Our primary goal was to make searching icons easier using tags. Each icon has multiple tags attached to it. The same "Hamburger menu" icon can be searched by typing "Three Lines", "Menu", "Dash", etc.  
  
Then designers can simply click the copy button and then press `⌘+V` or `Ctrl+V` to paste the vector graphic into your Figma file directly.
  
## Product Roadmap
  
- Mage Icons is still in its beta version. Our first priority is to improve the consistency and quality of our icons for all designs before we release the version 1. We're actively taking feedback from designers and our community.
- We are working on adding many more icons to the library, so that MageIcons can be your go to library for all projects.  
- Development environment support for all the major tech stacks will be rolled out in the future updates.
